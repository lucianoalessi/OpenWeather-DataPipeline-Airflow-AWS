# OpenWeather-DataPipeline-Airflow-AWS
This project consists of an Apache Airflow DAG running on an AWS EC2 instance. The DAG extracts weather data from a public API, processes it by converting temperatures from Kelvin to Fahrenheit, and stores the transformed data as a CSV file in an AWS S3 bucket.
